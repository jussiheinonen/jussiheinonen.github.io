                  Well-designed Delivery Pipelines increase productivity and makes work more enjoyable for product delivery team. 
                  Automation is a key characteristic of a Delivery Pipeline.

                  Typical Delivery Pipeline consists of multiple phases (or steps) that are executed in a sequential order. 
                  Each phase of a pipeline performs a specific task. 
                  When task is completed successfully, it triggers the next phase the pipeline automatically.
